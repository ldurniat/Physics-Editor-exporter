# Physics-Editor-exporter
Modified version of built-in exporter for Corona SDK

Exporter adds two new paramaters `xScale` and  `yScale` for individual body (image) upon exsiting built-in exporter. New options are available in Physics Editor after select exporter from list.
 
### Usage

1. Put `exporter.xml` and `corona.lua` in a new folder called `exporters\corona_ldurniat` located inside the application's folder. For me it is `C:\Program Files\CodeAndWeb\PhysicsEditor\resources\exporters\corona_ldurniat`.

2. To use it in Physics Editor you need to select `Corona SDK by ldurniat` exporter from list.

### Example

I have provided example project. To run it you need [Corona SDK](https://portal.coronalabs.com).
